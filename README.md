# Archive-box-database-system

### Archive Box Management Database: Garment and Textile
This project showcases a complete relational database design for managing a university garment and textile archive collection. The system handles archive operations, including storage tracking, patron checkouts, environmental monitoring, and item preservation across multiple storage rooms.
The project demonstrates:

- **Conceptual design**: ERD modeling with 19 normalized tables (up to 3NF)
- **Implementation**: MySQL database with triggers for automated workflows and data integrity
- **Query development**: Complex queries addressing real archivists, librarians, and administrator needs

Built using systematic database design principles from concept to working implementation, this project reflects graduate-level coursework in database systems.
